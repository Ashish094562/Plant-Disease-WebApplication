-  Achieved **~99.1% validation accuracy**
-  Low-latency inference (~43 ms mean, ~78 ms P95) on CPU
- Transfer Learning with EfficientNet
-  Optimized using TensorFlow Lite (FLOAT32)
-  REST API built using Flask
-  Modern responsive UI built with React
- Production deployment using Render (Backend) & Vercel (Frontend)
- Designed for CPU-based & edge-ready deployment
-  INT8 quantization planned for further optimization
